There is of course no ill intent in this (but boys please, practice your steady hands). This tradition is to symoblise that the groom is no longer a bachelor, and therefore no longer needs to impress potential partners with his outfit. Certain sources also claim it is the first `task` for the bride to fix the socks afterwards, but we all know Thomas is perfectly capable of fixing his own damn socks",
